# UltraLearning Checklist

## Principle_1, METALEARNING:
Have I done research into what are the typical ways of
learning this subject or skill? Have I interviewed successful learners to
see what resources and advice they can recommend? Have I spent about
10 percent of the total time on preparing my project?
   
## Principle_2, FOCUS:

Am I focused when I spend time learning, or am I multitasking
and distracted? Am I skipping learning sessions or procrastinating?
When I start a session, how long does it take before I’m in a good flow?
How long can I sustain that focus before my mind starts to wander?
How sharp is my attention? Should it be more concentrated for intensity
or more diffuse for creativity?

## Principle_3, DIRECTNESS:

Am I learning the skill in the way I’ll eventually be using
it? If not, what mental processes are missing from my practice that exist
in the real environment? How can I practice transferring the knowledge I
learn from my book/class/video to real life?

## Principle_4, DRILL:

Am I spending time focusing on the weakest points of my
performance? What is the rate-limiting step that is holding me back?
Does it feel as though my learning is slowing down and that there’s too
many components of the skill to master? If so, how can I split apart a
complex skill to work on smaller, more manageable components of it?

## Principle_5, RETRIEVAL:

 Am I spending most of my time reading and reviewing, or
am I solving problems and recalling things from memory without
looking at my notes? Do I have some way of testing myself, or do I just
assume I’ll remember? Can I successfully explain what I learned
yesterday, last week, a year ago? How do I know if I can?

## Principle_6, FEEDBACK:

 Am I getting honest feedback about my performance early
on, or am I trying to dodge the punches and avoid criticism? Do I know
what I’m learning well and what I’m not? Am I using feedback
correctly, or am I overreacting to noisy data?

## Principle_7, RETENTION:

 Do I have a plan in place to remember what I’m learning
long term? Am I spacing my exposure to information so it will stick
longer? Am I turning factual knowledge into procedures that I’ll retain?
Am I overlearning the most critical aspects of the skill?

## Principle_8, INTUITION:

 Do I deeply understand the things I’m learning, or am I just
memorizing? Could I teach the ideas and procedures I’m studying to
someone else? Is it clear to me why what I’m learning is true, or does it
all seem arbitrary and unrelated?

## Principle_9, EXPERIMENTATION:

 Am I getting stuck with my current resources and
techniques? Do I need to branch out and try new approaches to reach my
goal? How can I go beyond mastering the basics and create a unique
style to solve problems creatively and do things others haven’t explored
before?


- **Together these principles serve as directions, not destinations. In each case, look at how you’re currently progressing through your materials, and see what you could do differently.** 

- Do you need to switch resources? 
- Do you need to stick to the same resources but spend more time on a different kind of
practice? 
- Should you seek out new environments for feedback, directness, or
immersion? 
**These are all subtle adjustments you can make along the way**
