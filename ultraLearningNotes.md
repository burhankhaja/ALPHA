# UltraLearning In_depth Notes

## Principle_1, METALEARNING: 
**learning about learning** <br>
- **Why are you learning ?**
   - if intrumental: learning x to gain y, Ask yourself is it worth it to do x or do i need to look for alternatives
   - elif intrinsic: learning x for the sake of x, no worries😙
   - Schedule Expert interview (you can even book 15 min meet with experts on socialmedia__video_call)
- **What are You learning ?**
   - categorize target in this manner (rinse and repeat this method)
   - concepts__ things that need to be understood fundamentally, {teach others}
   - Facts__ things to be memorized {SRS}
   - Procedurals__ things to be practices {Practice 🍭}
- **How are you gonna learn ?**
   - Benchmarking__
       - common ways people use to learn
       - Expert Interview
   - Emphasize/Exclude Method__
       - 80/20 principle
       - Goal aligned tasks to be executed first
   - Extensive research__
       - 10% Rule__ 
         ```c
          // you can also spend only about 5%, the goal is to research well enough
          string elt = "expected learning time";
          string rt = "time on research";
          assert (10% * (elt) == rt);
         ```
       - **Goal here, is to not latch on first possible method/resource without thinking about alternatives-their strengths and weaknesses**
       - Follow Diminishing Returns/Marginal Benefit Calculation Principle
         ```c
           if (contribution(Research) > benefits(Action/learning)) {
                Research More;
           } else {
                Keep taking Action;
           }
         ```
## Principle_2, FOCUS:
- **Problem 1: Procrastination**
  - Detection:
     - desire to do y rather than x
     - difficulty of doing x
  - Fix:
     - 5min Rule: Just convince yourself to do x for 5 min, 80% probability is you will endup doing more
     - Pomodoro: 25min(x) -- 5min(rest) => avoids burnout on doing difficult x
- **Problem 2: Distractions**
   - source
      - environment (phone, games, playground...)
      - Difficulty of Task
         - **break x into x0, x1 to span attention for avoidance of boredom**
      - Mind (bad emotional state, addicted....)
- **Problem 3: Wrong Focus**
   - Utilizing wrong kind of focus in wrong situations
   - Fix:
   ```c
   // However, this rule isn't valid in all situations
   if (task == complex) {
       choose queit environment;
   } else {
       choose noisy environment;
   }
  ```

## Principle_3, Directness:
```c
// learning of skill must be directly proportional to its real-life utility
string lG = "learning";
string rU = "real life utility";
assert(lG == rU);
```
- **Frist thing to Ask is Where and How this knowledge that i am learning is going to manifest itself in real life situations**
- Remember, if You can't transfer your knowledge to where it can be used, you learning won't be efficient
**- How to learn Directly ?**
     - Project Based Learning
        - build as you learn
     - Immersive Learning
        - surround yourself with target environment in which skill is practiced, {kid's language learning analogy}
     - Fligh simulator method
        - simulate target environment for situations where transfer is not directly available
     - OverKill Approach
        - Increase challenge so that skill required is wholly contained {public speaking to subgroups before concerts analogy}
     - **Remember Always learn straight from source**

## Principle_4, Drill:
- **Identify and practice rate-determining steps- where one component of a complex skill determines your level of performance**
- Attack your weak spots individually, because they make complex things difficult to learn
- Utilize **Direct-Then-Drill** Approach:
   - start learning too hard, identify pre-requisites/rate-determining areas and practice them
   - Benefit: You sort out what components are applicable and efficient from inefficients ones
