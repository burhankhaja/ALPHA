# UltraLearning In_depth Notes

## Principle_1, METALEARNING: 
**learning about learning** <br>
- **Why are you learning ?**
   - if intrumental: learning x to gain y, Ask yourself is it worth it to do x or do i need to look for alternatives
   - elif intrinsic: learning x for the sake of x, no worries😙
   - Schedule Expert interview (you can even book 15 min meet with experts on socialmedia__video_call)
- **What are You learning ?**
   - categorize target in this manner (rinse and repeat this method)
   - concepts__ things that need to be understood fundamentally, {teach others}
   - Facts__ things to be memorized {SRS}
   - Procedurals__ things to be practices {Practice 🍭}
- **How are you gonna learn ?**
   - Benchmarking__
       - common ways people use to learn
       - Expert Interview
   - Emphasize/Exclude Method__
       - 80/20 principle
       - Goal aligned tasks to be executed first
   - Extensive research__
       - 10% Rule__ 
         ```c
          // you can also spend only about 5%, the goal is to research well enough
          string elt = "expected learning time";
          string rt = "time on research";
          assert (10% * (elt) == rt);
         ```
       - **Goal here, is to not latch on first possible method/resource without thinking about alternatives-their strengths and weaknesses**
       - Follow Diminishing Returns/Marginal Benefit Calculation Principle
         ```c
           if (contribution(Research) > benefits(Action/learning)) {
                Research More;
           } else {
                Keep taking Action;
           }
         ```
## Principle_2, FOCUS:
- **Problem 1: Procrastination**
  - Detection:
     - desire to do y rather than x
     - difficulty of doing x
  - Fix:
     - 5min Rule: Just convince yourself to do x for 5 min, 80% probability is you will endup doing more
     - Pomodoro: 25min(x) -- 5min(rest) => avoids burnout on doing difficult x
- **Problem 2: Distractions**
   - source
      - environment (phone, games, playground...)
      - Difficulty of Task
         - **break x into x0, x1 to span attention for avoidance of boredom**
      - Mind (bad emotional state, addicted....)
- **Problem 3: Wrong Focus**
   - Utilizing wrong kind of focus in wrong situations
   - Fix:
   ```c
   // However, this rule isn't valid in all situations
   if (task == complex) {
       choose queit environment;
   } else {
       choose noisy environment;
   }
  ```

## Principle_3, Directness:
```c
// learning of skill must be directly proportional to its real-life utility
string lG = "learning";
string rU = "real life utility";
assert(lG == rU);
```
- **Frist thing to Ask is Where and How this knowledge that i am learning is going to manifest itself in real life situations**
- Remember, if You can't transfer your knowledge to where it can be used, you learning won't be efficient
**- How to learn Directly ?**
     - Project Based Learning
        - build as you learn
     - Immersive Learning
        - surround yourself with target environment in which skill is practiced, {kid's language learning analogy}
     - Fligh simulator method
        - simulate target environment for situations where transfer is not directly available
     - OverKill Approach
        - Increase challenge so that skill required is wholly contained {public speaking to subgroups before concerts analogy}
     - **Remember Always learn straight from source**

## Principle_4, Drill:
- **Identify and practice rate-determining steps- where one component of a complex skill determines your level of performance**
- Attack your weak spots individually, because they make complex things difficult to learn
- Utilize **Direct-Then-Drill** Approach:
   - start learning too hard, identify pre-requisites/rate-determining areas and practice them
   - Benefit: You sort out what components are applicable and efficient from inefficients ones

## Principle_5, Retrieval:
- It states, after moderate gap since learning the concept, you should try to recall the concept again from memory rather than reviewing on resources
   - i think this may become inefficient for me
- **This is also implicable in situations where you recall without even first knowing the solutions, benefits ?**
   - This sets the path and triggers in your mind that are going to become picky to easily understand the solutions while learning
## Principle_6, Feedback:
- Am I getting honest feedback about my performance early on, or am I trying to dodge the punches and avoid criticism?
-  Do I know what I’m learning well and what I’m not?
-  Am I using feedback correctly, or am I overreacting to noisy data?
-  Am i getting faster feedback loop
-  Am i getting corrective feedback,(along with how to fix) rather than only informational feedback(only signals correctness/falseness)?
## Principle_7, Retention: 
- Use SRS (spaced repetition System) or space relearning sessions not too far and not too close
- you can even combine retrieval principle to acheive same effect in better but difficult way
- **Proceduralization:**
   - Humans remember procedural stuff easily over declarative knowledge
      - typecasting vs mathematical_theorms
   - Therefore, try to transfer declarative stuff into more procedural tasks
- **Overlearning:**
   - practice beyond perfect
      - over_practice
      - advance_practice
         - **increase difficulty of x to x^2, so that x is learned itself**
         - relatable to my difficulty bias theory, => we want to view something as difficult so changing difficulty order of x to x+1 to learn x easily
   - Mnemonics- visualizations
## Princple_8, Intuition:
- Cultivate Principles-first thinking
   - while solving problems, reason about the core truths of problems rather than superficial charateristics
   - build off examples that relate to what the target problem represents
- Don't give up on hard problems easily
   - try setting struggle timer before looking for answer
      - this will do the job of Pre-retrieval, which aids in reaching solutions easily
- Prove things to truly understand them
   - **illusion of understanding is very often the barrier to deeper knowledge**
   - Always start with concrete examples
      - humans don't learn well in abstract form
      - Transfer is necessary for us to learn
      - This gives direct feedback, How?
         - if you can't give example => you don't understand it well
      - Don't fool yourself by having illusion of understanding
   - Ask lots of dumb questions to assess whether you understand it deeply
      - By asking seemingly obvious questions to yourself, the not-so-obvious implications of things will comeup
      - Asking questions keep you from misunderstand of understanding
   - **Feynman's Techniques:**
      - write concept/problem to be understood/solved on top of piece of paper
      - explain as if you are teaching to compelete beginner, (at least with pre-requisites)
      - if you are easily able to teach it => you understand it
         - explain why your solutions makes sense in case of problem to be solved?
         - if you get stuck => you don't understand it
      - So the Focus should be on generating illustrative examples, analogies, visualizations and convey them to compelete beginner (at least in your imaginations)

## Principle_9, Experimentation:
- Experiment with #principles, (eg may be retrieval isn't good for me)
- Experiment with learning resources
   - how to learn
- Experiment with technique
   - what to learn next
- Experiment with style
   - Be aware of all the styles for doing things and experiment'em

- How to Experiment
   - copy, then create approach
   - compare methods, side-by-side
   - introduce new constraints
      - create constraints (tougher tasks) so that you wonder how to proceed forward => this will sharpen your underlying skills
   - Find Your superpower by connecting unrelated skills, eg:
        - public speaking + engineering
        - MMA (rather than: Boxer || taekwondo || wrestler)
   - Explore extreame zones:
      - push yourself to do extreame components of skill.
