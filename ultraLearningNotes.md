# UltraLearning In_depth Notes

## Principle_1, METALEARNING: 
**learning about learning** <br>
- **Why are you learning ?**
   - if intrumental: learning x to gain y, Ask yourself is it worth it to do x or do i need to look for alternatives
   - elif intrinsic: learning x for the sake of x, no worries😙
   - Schedule Expert interview (you can even book 15 min meet with experts on socialmedia__video_call)
- **What are You learning ?**
   - categorize target in this manner (rinse and repeat this method)
   - concepts__ things that need to be understood fundamentally, {teach others}
   - Facts__ things to be memorized {SRS}
   - Procedurals__ things to be practices {Practice 🍭}
- **How are you gonna learn ?**
   - Benchmarking__
       - common ways people use to learn
       - Expert Interview
   - Emphasize/Exclude Method__
       - 80/20 principle
       - Goal aligned tasks to be executed first
   - Extensive research__
       - 10% Rule__ 
         ```c
          // you can also spend only about 5%, the goal is to research well enough
          string elt = "expected learning time";
          string rt = "time on research";
          assert (10% * (elt) == rt);
         ```
       - **Goal here, is to not latch on first possible method/resource without thinking about alternatives-their strengths and weaknesses**
       - Follow Diminishing Returns/Marginal Benefit Calculation Principle
         ```c
           if contribution(Research) > benefits(Action/learning) {
                Research More;
           } else {
                Keep taking Action;
           }
         ```
