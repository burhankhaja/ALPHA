# ALPHA WAY TO LEARN AUDITING

## CONTESTS
- **`SHADOW AUDIT PREVIOUS CONTESTS`**
- you get a quick feedback loop after you compare performance against original report

## BUG BOUNTIES
- **`HACK-ANALYSIS && POSTMORTEMS`**
- gives you ideas about what type of issues are missed generally by auditors

## Be Specific
- **`Start With AMMs`**
- Don't go allout and audit every type of protocol
- start with One type of protocol, be it AMMs, lending-borrowing, zeroknowledge etc
